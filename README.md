## 📌 **Project Workflow**  

### 🔍 **Thorough Data Research**  
✅ Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand key patterns in house prices.  
✅ Identify important features such as **size, location, and condition**.  

### 🏗 **Structured Data Processing**  
✅ Implement **preprocessing pipeline** with feature engineering.  
✅ Apply **data validation and corrections** for better predictions.  

### 🤖 **Model Training & Evaluation**  
✅ Train machine learning models with **hyperparameter tuning**.  
✅ Validate assumptions and **track experiments using MLflow**.  

### 🔧 **MLOps & Production Readiness**  
✅ Use **ZenML** to manage the ML workflow.  
✅ Implement **CI/CD pipelines** for continuous deployment.  
✅ Ensure the model is **scalable, maintainable, and production-ready**.
